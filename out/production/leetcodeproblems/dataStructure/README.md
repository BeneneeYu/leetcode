- Duplicate problems may appear here because the multiple topics a problem is related.
- It's important to have command of the concepts, advantages and shortcomings, complexity, API in programming language and implementation.
- Array, matrix, string, hash is common data structures we use, problems in this chapter tend not to relate with other algorithms.
- Linked list is usually involved with operations on pointers, be patient and pay attention to details.
- Queue is usually used in BFS.
- Heap and Stack are always mixed with other topics.
- The template of Trie, Union Find, and Sweep Line is worth bearing in mind.
