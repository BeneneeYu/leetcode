# Problem

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of `nums` are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears **once** or **twice**, return *an array of all the integers that appears **twice***.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n) `time and uses only constant extra space.

# Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- Each element in `nums` appears **once** or **twice**.

# Solution

Can't solve the problem without the constraints on input data.

Notice that the restricted visit times and value range, so that we can use positive an negative to represent visit times.

Notice the range of array length and value range, so that we can map value to the element with the corresponding index.
