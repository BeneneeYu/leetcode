# Question

Given a string `s`, find *the longest palindromic **subsequence**'s length in* `s`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

# Idea

For a palindromic sequence, delete its head and tail character, it is still a palindromic sequence.
