# Case

- Sort an array
- Find an algorithm with less time complexity than $O(n)$
- Find a split position, elements on the left side of which qualify some conditions, while elements on the right side do not
- Find a maximum/minimum element to satisfy some condition

# Complexity

Time: $O(logn)$

Space: $O(1)$
