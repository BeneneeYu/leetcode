# Basic

In mathematics, the lexicographic or lexicographical order (also known as lexical order, or dictionary order) is a generalization of the alphabetical order of the dictionaries to sequences of ordered symbols or, more generally, of elements of a totally ordered set.

# Details

Any character is behind non-character.

If two elements are in lexicographical order in limited front digits, the two elements are in lexicographical order. (Don't need to think about the left digits)
