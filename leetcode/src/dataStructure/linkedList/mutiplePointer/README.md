# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

1. Set a dummy head node.
2. Initialize pointer `slow` and `fast`, let `fast` proceed length `n`.
3. Let `slow` and `fast` proceed simultaneously, when `fast` reaches the tail, `slow` is in the correct position.

# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

Two pointers point at the candidate nodes in the two lists, compare and link.
