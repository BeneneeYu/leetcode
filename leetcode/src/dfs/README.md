# Depth First Search

**Depth-first search** (**DFS**) is an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) for traversing or searching [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_data_structure) or [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(data_structure)) data structures. The algorithm starts at the [root node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)#Terminology) (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

1. The essential factors of recursion in DFS.
2. The selection of termination conditions; backtrack; prune.
3. When to sort?
4. How to remove duplicate elements?
5. The cases when an element can be used for several times?
6. How to avoid get to a duplicate node in traversal when performing DFS on a graph.
7. Recognize an implicit graph and perform DFS on it.
8. Use memorized search and optimize.
