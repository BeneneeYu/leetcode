# BFS or DFS?

- If we want to find out if at least one situation exists, DFS is more efficient because it returns when DFS finds a valid situation. But BFS will try out all the situations, which imports lots of unnecessary paths.
- If we want to find out the shortest path, BFS is more efficient because it tries out all situations, the first to reach is the shortest path.
